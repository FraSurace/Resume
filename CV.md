# **FRANCESCO SURACE** (Pipeline TD | Python Developer)

I always use two approaches: Technical and Artistic. 
The first one helps me to be a well-organized and efficient worker with a focus on problem solving, making the workflow solid and simple.
On the other hand, the artistic side pays attention to the smallest visual details, in order to maintain high quality.
